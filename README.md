# Annoying Cookie Site

This is a fun and sarcastic project that mimics those annoying cookie popups you see on websites â€“ but with a twist. It includes a fake modal that asks for your data in a humorous and exaggerated way.

# What It Does

- Shows a fake cookie/data consent popup after 1.5 seconds
- Annoyingly asks users for name and email
- Plays around with the "Decline" button to frustrate users
- Pretends to upload your data to the dark web (just for laughs)
- Gives a funny thank-you message once form is submitted
